Our Pokemon Project Progress:

Obstacles Overcome:
1. Got moves for Pokemons working (by hardcoding them into each Pokemon)
2. Built connections between Pokemons and the Battle.java file (readMove method in Pokemons)
3. Balancing issues (Use Nintendo's official stats + formulas)
4. Getting a basic battle working and creating gameover checks at appropriate points (Flow chart anaylsis)

Unresolved Issues:
1. Develop more efficient method of storing moves instead of just hardcoding
2. Develop trainer class for player character and potentially multiple trainer battles
3. System for keeping track of xp and leveling up when appropriate and modifying stats.
4. More Pokemons / More efficient Pokemon structure for faster development (ties into #1)

Cool Stuff Learned:
1. How Pokemon battles actually work.
2. How the YoRPG skeleton file actually worked.

Mid Development Design Changes:
1. Focus more on Battle module. Instead of trying to develop a small/buggy world try to create a Battle factory (Increasingly difficult battles, time to level up / buy items / heal up in between battles, legendary/rare Pokemon once certain conditions are met etc.) We decided that this will be more fun than a hastily put together text based world and will be easier to test/polish.

Lessons Learned:
Placeholders are awesome. When developing a big project it is good to focus on the "spine" with placeholders attatched to it. This allows the development of a working version much faster, boosting morale and preventing disorganization.
